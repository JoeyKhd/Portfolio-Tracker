## Portfolio Tracker

Since the crypto related websites based on WordPress are getting more and more by the day I decided to create a portfolio tracker which lets the users follow their own positions and view their profit/loss.
The page uses the CoinMarketCap's API to get the current prices, this ensures we always get the latest prices.
All positions are bound to the user's ID in WordPress and saved to the ```wp_portfolio``` table which is being generated automatically.

- Copy ```cryptocoins``` folder to root directory of your WordPress installation.
- Copy ```portfolio.php``` to the theme you are using.

- Voil√°, your all set! Let the magic begin!
